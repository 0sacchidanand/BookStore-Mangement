# Book Management System

This is a simple book management system built using Spring Boot. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books stored in a database.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Users can perform CRUD operations on books, including adding new books, viewing existing books, updating book information, and deleting books.
- **RESTful API**: The system provides a RESTful API for interacting with the book data.
- **Database Storage**: Book information is stored in a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) using Spring Data JPA.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Access to certain endpoints can be restricted based on user roles.
- **Validation**: Input data is validated to ensure its integrity and correctness.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For creating the application and managing dependencies.
- **Spring Data JPA**: For data access and persistence.
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: For storing book data.
- **Maven/Gradle**: For project build and dependency management.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone 


6. **Access the application:**

- Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080`.
